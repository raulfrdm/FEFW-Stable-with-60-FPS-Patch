# Changelog

## v1.6.1

- **Fixed: 8 GB graphics cards dropping to about 2 FPS for minutes** (reported on an RX 7600 at nightfall). To re-compress a texture on the GPU, v1.6 first decodes it into a temporary full-colour image four times the texture's size, which can't be freed until the GPU is done with it. When a scene loads many textures at once, these piled up: on that card, 757 MB in half a second, past what the driver allows, so textures spilled into system memory and the game crawled at 2 FPS for three minutes. The temporary images now share a limit of 1/64 of the card's memory (128 MB on an 8 GB card, at most 256 MB), and over it the GPU's earlier work is waited for and its images reused. The log notes the first 20 times this happens.
- **Correction: v1.6 never had a UI ghosting bug.** The ghosting reported during v1.6 testing (button prompts at the screen edges leaving a faint shifted copy while moving) came from **NVIDIA Smooth Motion**, the driver's frame generation, which was switched on for `Fortune's Eden.exe` in the NVIDIA app. It only showed with that exe name, which is why renamed test builds looked clean, and it was wrongly blamed on a faulty v1.6 build. If you see UI smearing while moving, turn off Smooth Motion (NVIDIA app → Graphics → Program Settings) or frame generation in Lossless Scaling for this program.
- **The resolution options show this game's real sizes.** They still listed the original Switch 1 sizes (1X as 720p/1080p). Fortune's Weave on Switch 2 draws its 3D scene at 720p and upscales it with its own DLSS to 1440p, and the setting scales both, so the options now read 1X (1440p, native), 1.5X (2160p, 4K), 2X (2880p, 5K), 3X (4320p, 8K) and so on (docked mode).

## v1.6

- **Battle starts no longer freeze while textures convert: ASTC textures are now re-compressed on the GPU** (ported from Eglantine, Duck912). The game's textures are ASTC, which PC graphics cards can't use directly. Until now there were two choices: *Uncompressed*, converted on the GPU but needing so much video memory that only 20 GB cards could use it safely, or *BC3*, a quarter of the size but converted on the CPU, on the thread that prepares every frame, so the picture and sound froze for a moment whenever a battle loaded many textures at once. Now, with *ASTC decoding* on *GPU* (the default), the graphics card decodes each texture and re-compresses it to BC3 itself, off the CPU. In testing, a large battle on BC3 that used to freeze ran at 57-60 FPS throughout, using 7-11 GB of video memory where Uncompressed used 15-19 GB.
- **ASTC recompression Auto now always picks BC3** when the GPU re-compresses (Vulkan with *ASTC decoding* on *GPU*). The 20 GB rule is gone, so 8-16 GB cards get the same smooth result as big ones. With the CPU decoding modes or OpenGL, Auto keeps the v1.5.1 rule. *Uncompressed* is still there for anyone who wants the best image and has the video memory; *BC1* and *BC3* chosen by hand are re-compressed on the GPU too. The log says what Auto picked and when the first texture is re-compressed on the GPU. `EDEN_GPU_BCN_TRANSCODE=0` goes back to re-compressing on the CPU, for comparisons.
- **Smoother play when video memory fills up.** ASTC textures are slow to convert, so the texture cache kept them until memory was almost full and then had to throw many away at once, which stuttered. Once memory use passes the expected level, ASTC textures that haven't been used for 30 seconds are now freed early instead. In testing with video memory capped at 7 GB, a scene that dropped to about 35 FPS ran at 55-60.
- Includes v1.5.2's fix for the NVIDIA DLSS crash.

## v1.5.2

- **Fixes a crash with NVIDIA DLSS on** (ported from Eglantine, Duck912). A few minutes into some sessions, often at a scene change, the emulator closed with an error in `nvoglv64.dll` (NVIDIA's driver). Drawing DLSS's output into the game's image read its target framebuffer on the graphics driver's thread, after the texture cache could already have removed it, so the driver was asked to draw into a framebuffer that no longer existed. It now reads the framebuffer when the command is recorded. This was also in v1.5 and v1.5.1.

## v1.5.1

- **Game updates: the right version, and loose updates** ([#11](https://github.com/TheSneakyBadger/FEFW-Stable-with-60-FPS-Patch/issues/11)). The game's main menu always showed v1.0.0 for a `.nup` or a loose dump, even with an update in it, because the emulator only knew the version of installed games. It now reports the update's version, also for a `.nup` that doesn't record one (it then reads the update's own control data, or recognises the 1.1.0 build). Loose dumps can now carry an update too: put it in an `updates\<number>\` folder (with its `exefs`, `romfs` and `control.nacp`) next to the dump's `exefs`/`romfs`, or next to a `base` folder holding the dump. The newest one runs, with its files laid over the base's. **Note:** the ultrawide option is made for game version 1.1.0 (code build `DB93B012…`); other versions have different code, so it doesn't apply to them. The 60 FPS patch is set up for 1.1.0 too and may also work on 1.0.0 (not confirmed yet). The log's `name=main` line shows which build is running.
- **Big graphics cards can use more of their video memory.** The default *VRAM Usage Mode* (Conservative) capped every card from 8 GB up at about 7 GB, even a 24 GB one, so at higher resolutions or with the ultrawide option the emulator kept clearing and reloading textures. It now allows three quarters of the card's memory, and never less than before: 8 GB and smaller cards are unchanged, a 12 GB card gets 9 GB, a 16 GB card 12 GB, a 24 GB card 18 GB. The free quarter avoids the stutter *Aggressive* can cause by running right up to the card's limit. The log shows the limit.
- **ASTC recompression is now Auto by default.** The game's textures are ASTC, which PC graphics cards can't use directly, so the emulator converts them. *Uncompressed* is converted on the GPU (smoothest, best quality) but needs a lot of video memory; *BC3* takes a quarter of the space but is converted on the CPU, which can freeze the picture and sound for a moment when a battle loads many textures at once. *Auto* picks for you at each start: **Uncompressed** when the emulator may use about 15 GB of video memory or more (in practice 20 GB cards and up, such as an RTX 3090/4090 or RX 7900 XT/XTX) and the resolution is below 1.5x (with the ultrawide option, only at 1x); **BC3** otherwise. The log says which it picked and why. Choosing Uncompressed, BC1 or BC3 yourself still works as before. New installs get Auto, and so do configs that never changed this setting.
  > ⚠️ **Don't pick Uncompressed by hand on a card with less than 20 GB of video memory.** The game used 13.5 GB within a minute at 1x with ultrawide on Uncompressed: on smaller cards it runs out of memory, and the game stutters or drops to single-digit FPS (an RX 7700 XT fell to about 5 FPS in Dagsion). If you copied an old `user` folder that has Uncompressed set, change it to Auto in *Graphics → Advanced → ASTC recompression*.
- **Sound no longer stutters when the CPU is busy** ([#8](https://github.com/TheSneakyBadger/FEFW-Stable-with-60-FPS-Patch/issues/8)). The threads that mix the game's sound ran at a lower priority than the emulated CPU cores and the GPU threads, so on CPUs with 4 fast cores they only got leftover time in battles and busy cutscenes, and the sound stuttered or crackled. They now run at the same top priority. They only mix for a few milliseconds at a time, so nothing else slows down.
- **The emulator's threads wait properly on newer CPUs** (ported from Eglantine #120 and #137). On Intel 12th gen and newer, and in some cases on AMD, a thread waiting for a set time could wake early and report "timed out" (or miss a signal), so threads like the timing thread kept waking and rechecking instead of sleeping, using CPU the game could have had. They now wait until the deadline or the signal.
- **Laptops and 4-core CPUs: smoother sound.** This build splits the GPU work over two busy threads for extra speed. On CPUs with only 4 fast cores (many laptops have 4 fast and 4 slow ones) that second thread competed with the game's own threads, and battles' sound crackled or beeped even at 30 FPS ([#8](https://github.com/TheSneakyBadger/FEFW-Stable-with-60-FPS-Patch/issues/8)). It's now off automatically on CPUs with 4 or fewer fast cores; the log says which way it went. `EDEN_GPU_SPLIT=2` turns it back on, `EDEN_GPU_SPLIT=0` turns it off anywhere.
- **Logs show frame pacing again, without growing back.** Every 10 seconds one line gives the FPS, the average and worst time between frames, and how many frames took over 50 ms and over 100 ms. So a log shows whether a PC keeps up, at about 360 lines an hour instead of one line per frame (v1.4.2's 27 MB logs).
- **Logs show video memory use** about once a minute, the texture cache's limits at the start, and any cleanup of old textures that takes 20 ms or more.
- **Logs record what NVIDIA DLSS is given whenever it changes**, not only at the start, to track down scenes where it misbehaves ([#5](https://github.com/TheSneakyBadger/FEFW-Stable-with-60-FPS-Patch/issues/5)).
- **Fewer shader hitches during fades** (from Eglantine #544, measured on this game: one scene built 101 shaders instead of 925). When the game fades something in or out with its alpha test on, the cut-off value moved by less than one visible step each frame, and each value built a new shader. It's now rounded to the 256 steps the game's textures can actually show.
- **Cutscene video keeps up with the voices** (adapted from Eglantine). The game shows one video frame for each frame it draws, so on a PC that runs a cutscene below the video's frame rate, the picture fell further and further behind the sound. Frames the sound has already passed are now skipped, so the picture catches up. Nothing changes on a PC that keeps up. `EDEN_VIDEO_PACE=0` turns it off.
- **Crash fixes from Eglantine:**
  - The GPU no longer keeps old data after some memory copies.
  - The window can be resized, fullscreened or alt-tabbed without the swapchain being destroyed while the GPU still uses it.
  - A shader that fails to build no longer crashes the driver; its draws are skipped.
  - A depth-buffer copy no longer loses the device on NVIDIA.
  - Two threads can no longer clear the same list of GPU-written memory at once.
  - Stopping the game no longer crashes with *ASTC decoding* set to *CPU Asynchronously* (a texture still decoding wrote into freed memory).

## v1.5

- **Fixed: the sky turning black after opening the map** (in Dagsion: blue in the menu, black after the map, sometimes staying black). The emulator's texture cache frees images that haven't been used for a few frames. Images the GPU drew into are normally kept or copied back to game memory first, but some (ones that overlap other images awkwardly) were freed with nothing kept. The game draws its sky colour table once and keeps reading it, so when the map covered the screen long enough for the table to be freed, the emulator rebuilt it from game memory, which never had it: black sky, clouds still fine. Small images the GPU drew (up to 4 MB; the sky table is one) are now always kept, even when video memory is nearly full; larger ones are still freed as before. In testing the sky stayed blue through every map visit (it went black on the first visit before), keeping at most about 160 MB more.
- **Slightly smoother busy scenes.** In crowds the GPU back thread, which limits the frame rate there, asks "has the GPU written to this memory?" about 850,000 times a second, and 87% of the answers are no. A bitmap with one bit per 4 KiB page now answers most of those without searching the range tree. The answers are exactly the same (a page is only cleared after a full search finds it empty); tested against a byte-by-byte reference over about 1.7 million random queries. A small gain in crowded towns, none elsewhere. `EDEN_NO_PAGE_FILTER=1` turns it off.
- **Fixed: recurring stutter for some players** ([#2](https://github.com/TheSneakyBadger/FEFW-Stable-with-60-FPS-Patch/issues/2)). Since v1.3.1, each CPU core skipped the GPU-cache check for the last 16 pages it wrote to instead of only the last one. Testing had already shown that this made the game "feel like 10 FPS" while the FPS counter looked fine: the game's writes reached the GPU one batch late, so frames came out unevenly. It went into the build anyway, by mistake, and the docs said it was off. It's off now (back to 1 page, as in v1.3). `EDEN_CPU_WRITE_PAGES=16` still turns it on for testing. Thanks to the player who traced it.
- **Fixed: cutscene voices missing and dialogue animations ending early with CPU Clocks on Boost or Overclock** ([#1](https://github.com/TheSneakyBadger/FEFW-Stable-with-60-FPS-Patch/issues/1)). Those settings made the game's clock run 1.7× (Boost) or 2× (Overclock) too fast, so movies played at about 51 FPS instead of 30 and their voices dropped out. The game's clock now always runs at the real rate, and the CPU Clocks setting is gone; a saved Boost or Overclock no longer does anything.
- **Much smaller logs.** A 34-minute session wrote a 27 MB log, too big to send most places: 87% of it was one line written every frame. That line now only appears for the first few frames and when the picture size changes, and "Unmapped Device ReadBlock" is logged once per read instead of once per 4 KiB page. The same session now writes about 1-2 MB.
- **The version is in the window title** (*Fortune's Eden v1.5*) and at the top of the log, so it's clear which release a log came from.
- **Optional ultrawide 3440x1440 (21:9) setting, off by default.** *Graphics → Ultrawide 3440x1440 (21:9) for Fortune's Weave* applies [Kompas9](https://github.com/Kompas9/Switch-Game-Patches)'s ultrawide patch (v1.1, MIT, built in) when the game starts and stretches the picture to the window: the 3D camera is widened to 3440x1440 and the HUD, menus and movies stay centred at 16:9 (movies get black bars). For 21:9 monitors, played fullscreen. Only for game version 1.1.0 (build ID `DB93B0125F485060`); other versions are left alone. A setting rather than a mod folder, so it stays off when an older `user` folder is copied over this build.

**Updating from v1.4.2:** replace `Fortune's Eden.exe` with the new one, or extract v1.5 to a new folder and copy your old `user` folder into it.

## v1.4.2

- **Fixed: 3D scenes losing their background** (bath scenes went black around the characters, sometimes only after a while). Some scenes use a compute shader with a shared-memory compare-and-swap (`ATOMS.CAS`), which the native shader translator didn't support, so every run of it was skipped. It's now translated (to a Vulkan atomic compare-exchange).
- **Another bath-scene shader no longer skipped:** a float add to GPU memory (`RED.ADD.F32`) is now translated too.

**Updating from v1.4.1:** replace `Fortune's Eden.exe` with the new one, or extract v1.4.2 to a new folder and copy your old `user` folder into it.

## v1.4.1

- **Cutscenes no longer drop to about 5 FPS.** Fortune's Weave's 1440p cutscenes are AV1 videos, and in their busiest scenes decoding a frame took up to ~40 ms, more than the 33 ms a 30 FPS video allows. Whenever the video fell behind, the game's frame rate collapsed until the scene got lighter. Their frames are encoded as a single tile, so the decoder (libgav1) worked mostly on one thread however many it had. It now decodes several frames at once (frame-parallel, 12 threads on a 16-thread CPU): in the same cutscene the decoder now keeps up with time to spare, and the cutscene plays at a steady 30 FPS. `EDEN_AV1_THREADS=N` sets the thread count; `EDEN_AV1_FRAME_PARALLEL=0` decodes one frame at a time as before.
- **Stricter check on the v1.3.1 handle-table shortcut** (a precaution for the sky sometimes turning dark in Dagsion). The shortcut reuses texture-handle tables the game builds on the GPU instead of waiting for them, and checks the GPU's copy afterwards. A table now needs 32 identical reads before the shortcut is used for it (was 8), a table that ever changes is always waited for from then on, and every table is still read for real at least every 250 ms. Changes are logged (`Texture-handle table ... changed`). In testing no table changed, so 60 FPS keeps the v1.3.1 gain. `EDEN_SPECULATIVE_HANDLES=0` still turns the shortcut off.

- **A copied `user` folder now uses its own saves.** Settings stored the full path of the build's NAND, SD, mod and dump folders, so a `user` folder copied into a new build (as the update steps say) kept using the folders of the build it came from: saves kept going to the old folder, and *Open Save Data Location* opened that one. Paths pointing at another build's `user\nand` (and `sdmc`, `load`, `dump`, `tas`) are now ignored in favour of this build's own, and this build's own folders are stored without a full path, so the `user` folder works wherever it is copied. A folder you picked yourself elsewhere is kept. If you updated by copying a `user` folder before, your latest saves may still be in the old build's `user\nand`: copy that `nand` folder over this build's `user\nand`.

**Updating from v1.4:** extract v1.4.1 to a new folder and copy your old `user` folder into it.

## v1.4

> **30 FPS is how Fortune's Weave runs on Switch 2**, and this build runs it smoothly by default. The 60 FPS patch stays **off by default**.

- **Optional NVIDIA DLSS in place of the game's own DLSS** (GeForce RTX cards). The game upscales with a small DLSS network made for the Switch 2, which can leave ghosting around moving characters. With *Graphics → Use NVIDIA DLSS in place of the game's DLSS* ticked, the full PC version of NVIDIA DLSS (through NVIDIA Streamline) does that step instead, from the game's own colour, depth, motion vectors and camera jitter. Off by default. NVIDIA's files aren't included: the **Download from NVIDIA** button under the setting fetches them from NVIDIA's Streamline release (or uses the DLSS the NVIDIA app has downloaded). If DLSS can't run, the game's own DLSS runs as before. Ported from Duck912's work in Eglantine; this build looks up DLSS's input images without creating any, which stopped driver crashes in an early port.
- **New default image settings:** AMD FSR window filter at **0% sharpness** (was 50%) and **FXAA** anti-aliasing (was off). FXAA softens the ghosting of the game's own DLSS, and 50% sharpness looked oversharpened with NVIDIA DLSS.

**Updating from v1.3.1:** extract v1.4 to a new folder and copy your old `user` folder into it. A copied `user` folder keeps your old image settings: set *Window Adapting Filter* sharpness to 0% and *Anti-Aliasing* to FXAA yourself if you want the new defaults.

## v1.3.1

> **30 FPS is how Fortune's Weave runs on Switch 2**, and this build still runs it smoothly by default. The 60 FPS patch stays **off by default**, but it's noticeably smoother in busy scenes now; on a fast PC, try it at **1x resolution**.

- **Smoother 60 FPS in busy scenes.** The game builds some texture-handle tables with compute shaders and draws with them a few draws later. Reading them back made the emulator wait for the GPU about once a frame (up to ~1.3 ms), although the tables never change. Once a table has come back identical 8 times in a row, the emulator uses the copy it already has, checks the GPU's version once it's ready, and goes back to waiting for that table if they ever differ (in testing they never did). `EDEN_SPECULATIVE_HANDLES=0` turns this off.
- **Less lock contention from CPU writes.** Each CPU core now remembers the last 16 GPU-owned pages it wrote to (was 1), so repeated writes skip the cache lock: up to ~200,000 fewer lock calls a second in busy scenes. `EDEN_CPU_WRITE_PAGES=1` restores the old behaviour.
- **Fewer shader-compile stutters:** translated shaders are reused between graphics pipelines that share them (Wael3rd, from PokeDinner, an Eglantine fork). `EDEN_NX2_SHADER_REUSE=0` turns it off.
- **Measured** on a Ryzen 7 9800X3D + RTX 4090 at 60 FPS, 1x, running the same loop in Dagsion: doubled frames in the busiest section went from about 45% to about 20%; over the whole run, frames on time went from 78% to 89%.
- **Profile-guided optimisation retrained** with these changes.
- **Build script:** `-Symbols` builds a copy with debugging symbols for profiling (same code).

**Updating from v1.3:** extract v1.3.1 to a new folder and copy your old `user` folder into it (saves, settings and shader cache), or just `user\nand` for saves only.

## v1.3

> **30 FPS is how Fortune's Weave runs on Switch 2**, and this build runs it smoothly by default. The 60 FPS patch stays **off by default**; on a fast PC, try it at **1x resolution**.

> **Saves are stored next to `Fortune's Eden.exe`** (in `user\nand`), **not** in `%APPDATA%\eden`. See [Saves](README.md#saves).

- **Renamed to Fortune's Eden:** the app is now `Fortune's Eden.exe`, and its window is titled *Fortune's Eden*.
- **Profile-guided optimisation** trained on Fortune's Weave (Dagsion, battles, menus). The emulator's CPU-side code is laid out for the paths the game uses; still runs on any x64 CPU. At 60 FPS it cut doubled frames by about a quarter in testing; at 30 FPS the game was already on time almost every frame.
- **Loose files and `.nup` share one save folder.** Loose-file dumps now register the game's real ID (`04007EF01F8AE000`) instead of `0000000000000000`. The first time you start the game, an old loose-file save is copied across automatically if there's no save under the new ID yet (the old folder is kept).
- **Shutdown and restart fixes** from PokeDinner (an Eglantine fork): no hang on stop when the audio renderer outlives its manager (kraibse); starting the game again in the same window no longer hangs or crashes (Takoroka).
- **Error-reporting crash fix** and clearer logs for unsupported system calls and missing keys (xDarkWindx).
- **60 FPS advice:** measured on a Ryzen 7 9800X3D + RTX 4090, 1x resolution halved the 60 FPS choppiness compared with 2x (doubled frames 3.4% vs 6.5%).
- **Build script:** portable PGO (`-Pgo Train` / `-Pgo Use`) and `Save-PGO.ps1`.

**Updating from v1.2.x:** extract v1.3 to a new folder and copy your old `user\nand` folder into it (and `user\cache` to keep the shader cache). Loose-file saves are carried over automatically.

## v1.2.1

- **All settings are now global** (*Emulation → Configure*) instead of in a Fortune's Weave per-game profile, including the 12 GB memory layout. A per-game profile only applies when the game's ID matches exactly, so some dumps (for example a `.nup` packed with a different ID) or an old `user` folder copied over could fall back to the defaults, including 4 GB, which hangs on loading. The global settings now match what the profile had: GPU accuracy Fast, asynchronous shaders on, vsync off, 16x anisotropic filtering, reactive flushing off, VRAM Conservative, FSR at 50% sharpness, anti-aliasing off. The emulator itself is unchanged from v1.2.

**Updating from v1.2:** no need to re-download if your game loads. Otherwise set *Emulation → Configure → System → Memory Layout* to **12 GB**, or extract v1.2.1 and copy your `user\nand` folder into it.

## v1.2

> **The 60 FPS patch is now OFF by default.** Its frame pacing is poor and can feel choppy, while 30 FPS runs flawlessly. It's still included: to try it, right-click the game → *Properties → Add-Ons* and tick **60fps**.

> **Saves are stored next to `eden.exe`** (in `user\nand`), **not** in `%APPDATA%\eden`. See [Saves](README.md#saves).

- **60 FPS patch off by default** (unticked under *Add-Ons*; the files are still included).
- **AMD graphics fix:** shader registers read before being written are now zero, as on NVIDIA, instead of leftover garbage that can show as stray coloured patches on AMD GPUs. Ported from [Djihads80's Eglantine](https://github.com/Djihads80/Eglantine) (by arisqz). No change on NVIDIA.
- **Preset graphics:** AMD FSR window adapting filter at 50% sharpness, anti-aliasing off (was FXAA).
- **Building from source fixed:** `cmake-options.txt` is now in the repo, and the README lists exactly what to put together.
- `source.zip` updated with the AMD fix.

**Updating from v1.1:** extract v1.2 to a new folder and copy your old `user\nand` folder into it to keep your saves. If you copy the whole old `user` folder instead, your old graphics and 60 FPS settings come with it.

## v1.1

> **The 60 FPS patch has poor frame pacing: it can feel choppy and uneven. At the game's normal 30 FPS this build runs flawlessly.**
> The patch is on by default. For the smoothest experience, turn it off. If it still feels choppy **delete** the folder `user\load\04007EF01F8AE000\60fps` (next to `eden.exe`). Unticking it under *Add-Ons* isn't always enough.

> **Saves are stored next to `eden.exe`** (in `user\nand`), **not** in `%APPDATA%\eden`. Copy your `nand` folder in to keep existing saves. See [Saves](README.md#saves).

- **`.nup` support.** Fortune's Weave can now be played from a single `.nup` package as well as from loose files. Add the folder that holds it to the game list, or open it with *File → Load File*. The NUP loader is ported from [Djihads80's Eglantine](https://github.com/Djihads80/Eglantine) (GPL-3.0-or-later). Only playing is supported: packing, unpacking and editing NUPs aren't included, and add-on content inside a `.nup` isn't loaded.
- **VRAM Usage Mode is now Conservative** in the Fortune's Weave profile (it was Aggressive). On Aggressive the texture cache can grow to almost the whole graphics card during a long session and spill into system RAM, causing repeated one-second freezes of picture and sound after about half an hour. Conservative caps it at about 6 GB plus 1 GB per resolution-scale step.
- The download zip now uses standard forward-slash paths, so it extracts correctly with 7-Zip and other tools as well as Windows.
- `source.zip` is updated with the NUP code.
- **Switching from loose files to `.nup`?** The two save to different folders (`0000000000000000` vs `04007EF01F8AE000` inside your profile folder). Copy the first to the second to carry your progress over. See [Saves](README.md#saves).

**Updating from v1.0:** extract v1.1 to a new folder, then copy your old `user\nand` folder into it to keep your saves (or copy the whole old `user` folder to keep your settings and shader cache too). If you copy the whole `user` folder, set VRAM Usage Mode to Conservative yourself: right-click the game → *Properties → Graphics → Advanced*.

## v1.0

- First release: portable build of xDarkWindx's eden-fefw 1.12 (on Duck912's Fortune's Weave fork) with a start-up crash fix, settings tuned for Fortune's Weave, the 60 FPS patch and the Microsoft C++ runtime included.
